# Creating-heatmaps-from-bacpp-results
This is an easy to use code to take the .txt file that BacPP gives you into a heatmap to test prokaryotic promoter strength. You can modify the heatmap however you'd like it to be modified. I tried to comment to make it easier to use and will add a GUI in future iterations
