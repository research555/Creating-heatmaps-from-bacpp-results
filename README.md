# Creating-heatmaps-from-bacpp-results
This is an easy to use code to take the .txt file that BacPP gives you into a heatmap to test prokaryotic promoter strength. You can modify the heatmap however you'd like it to be modified. I tried to comment to make it easier to use and will add a GUI in future iterations. For now you're going to have to do this manually.

Bear in mind you can only use this if you ticked 'select all' on the BacPP website. There is no reason for this but it was just easier to standardize this way. Future iterations will be variable though. Also, I can't get access to a BacPP API but I can make one if demand is there. Then you wont need to use the website but instead input your sequence onto the GUI itself.

Enjoy, remember the human and if you like this repo, give it a star :)

## UPDATE

I have started adding a GUI and an option to select multiple sequences. The branch is called gui but it is not yet fully functional.
